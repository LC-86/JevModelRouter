# Contributing to AutoJev

Thank you for helping improve AutoJev. Bug reports, focused feature proposals, documentation fixes, and pull requests are welcome.

## Before opening a change

- Search existing issues and pull requests first.
- Open an issue before investing in a large feature or architectural change.
- Never include API keys, prompts containing private data, credential-store exports, or real agent configuration files.
- Keep changes focused. Separate refactors from behavior changes when practical.

## Local setup

Install Node.js 22+, pnpm 10+, Rust stable, and the Tauri prerequisites for your platform. Then run:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Before submitting a pull request, run:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm release:check
cargo test --locked --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --lib
```

If a Rust dependency or Tauri configuration changes, also run:

```bash
pnpm tauri build --no-bundle
```

## Pull requests

A useful pull request explains the problem, the behavior after the change, how it was verified, and any security or compatibility impact. Include screenshots for interface changes.
